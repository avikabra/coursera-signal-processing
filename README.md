# coursera-signal-processing
In this repository, there are numerous files that utilize audio signal processing techniques including but not limited to the STFT, HPR, and the DFT in Python to manipulate and break down audio samples. The 'lesson' files all correspond to different lessons in the Coursera Signal Processing course on Coursera made by the Universitat de Pompeu Fabra in collaboration with Stanford University. Additionally, the sms-tools-master folder is a resource made by Xavier Serra including software to process audio files in a multitude of fashions.
